<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>You created a Collective a while ago, and I'm wondering if youâ€™d like any help to get it going. Managing a project and raising money can be challenging. We are here to support you!</p>

<p>Open Collective is collaborative and transparent. Check out some <a href="https://blog.opencollective.com/tag/case-studies/">Collective stories</a> to see how they're making their communities sustainable. You can reach out to any Collective by clicking their contact buttonâ€”they may share insights!</p>

<p>Let us know if you need any help setting things up or have any questions. <a href="http://calendly.com/piamancini/call">Schedule a call with me</a>), reply to this email, or <a href="https://slack.opencollective.com">join our Slack</a>.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>PÃ­a, and the Open Collective Team</p>
